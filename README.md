## Getting Started

- Install NodeJs from [NodeJs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open Terminal
- Go to your file project (where you've unzipped the product)
- Run in terminal `npm install`
- Then run `npm start`
- Or you can simply run `npm run install:clean` (if you use a linux based terminal) which will install `node_modules` and also will start your project.
- If you have an error something containing **Module not found** you need to add our `jsconfig.json` file to your project
- If you have an error containing **props.history of undefined** (this can happen when you integrate our project with another one) then you need to make the changes found [here](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/ct-material-dashboard-pro-react/issues/70)
